* B.S. in Physics, Shandong Normal University, 2020-2022

Work experience
======
* Jun.- Aug. 2024: Quantum Algorithm Development Internship
  * Quantum Tech Yangtze River Delta Industrial Innovation Center
  * Duties include: Study and develop approximate quantum algorithm(e.g. QA/QAOA, IQAOA, QAOA-in-QAOA)
  * Project: [Applied QA/QAOA algorithms in currency arbitrage problem.](../files/project1)

Course Project
======
* Apr. 2024: [Exploration of Quantum Computation Implement: a Scheme for Quantum Computation with Linear Optics](../files/project0)
    * Introduce how KLM protocol realized qubits by photons and created quantum gates with linear optics.
    * Describe the protocol for increasing the probability of success of quantum gates to near-determinism.

* Mar. 2024: [Exploration of Laser Physics](../files/project0)
  * Explored the stimulated emission, population inversion, Helium-Neon laser, laser cavity, and cavity modes.
  * Built a laser cavity and tested its maximum power.

* Jan. 2024: [Exploration of NMR](../files/project0)
  * Used an independent pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer to introduce the principle of pulsed NMR.
  * Explored several pulse (FID, SE and IR) sequences and measured the T1, T2 for several materials.
