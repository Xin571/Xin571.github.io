Hi! I'm an undergraduate student from [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). I enjoy exploring physics and mathematics. I like explaining the principles behind phenomena to others and also strive to figure out anything I don't know. 

I have good experimental skills. I have explored a few physics topics(e.g. laser and nuclear physics) through experiments and have written related experimental reports. I enjoy hands-on experimentation, which is an exciting way for me to learn. 

I also have strong coding skills and can model real-world problems into mathematical/physical models and simulate them using Python. During the internship, I complete my project about solving an optimization task with quantum algorithms.

You can find my CV here: [Xin's Curriculum Vitae](../files/XIN_Resume.pdf).
